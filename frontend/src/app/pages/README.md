# Pages Module

This folder contains standalone pages that don't belong to a specific feature.

## Current Pages
- `not-found/` - 404 error page for unknown routes

## Purpose
Use this folder for:
- Error pages (404, 403, 500, etc.)
- Static informational pages (about, help, privacy policy)
- Landing pages

## Guidelines
- Keep pages simple and focused
- Pages should be standalone components
- If a page grows complex, consider moving it to `features/`
